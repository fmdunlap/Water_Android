Waterâ„¢ - An app with a two-fold purpose. 
1) To educate the young, and the old alike.
2) To provide access to clean water to those who need it around the world. 
	(In collaboration with charity: water).

The app itself presents simply: We provide users the opportunity to play educational
games, take quizes, and read articles. During this time we display ads for one purpose
- to raise money for charity: water. Simply by using the app, you're raising money for
a cause greater than yourself.
