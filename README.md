# Water_Android
Water is an android app I wrote for my Android Development class at USC. It also just so happens to be a good portfolio project.

Waterâ„¢ - An app with a two-fold purpose.
1) To educate the young, and the old alike.
2) To provide access to clean water to those who need it around the world.
	(In collaboration with charity: water).

The app itself presents simply: We provide users the opportunity to play educational
games, take quizes, and read articles. During this time we display ads for one purpose
- to raise money for charity: water. Simply by using the app, you\'re raising money for
a cause greater than yourself.


APIs Used:
	-Firebase+Google Sign-in for storing user info, score counts, global stats, etc.
	-Maps for displaying geo-info (regional competition) about the \'game\'s players\'.
	-AdMob for revenue generation (Core point about the game)
	-Twitter/Facebook for the purpose of sharing
	-POSSIBLY: Google Analytics for me myself and I. I\'m curious about who would useit.

Technologies Used:
	-Notifications, probably. Lame, I know.
	-Material Design. Just for modernity.
	-Probably an addition API/REST service for content purposes.
